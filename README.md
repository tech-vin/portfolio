# Vineet's Portfolio & CV Repository

Welcome to my portfolio repository!

## 🔄 Monthly Updated CV
I update my CV every month in a separate branch named after the month, following this format: `Month-Year`.

### 📌 Latest CV — May 2025
To view my most recent CV, switch to the branch:

[`Resume May 2025`](https://github.com/tech-vin/portfolio/tree/Vineet_Resume_May2025.pdf)

Or use the branch dropdown at the top-left of this page to select the desired month.

- [`April 2025`](https://github.com/tech-vin/portfolio/tree/Vineet_Resume_April2025)
- [`May 2025`](https://github.com/tech-vin/portfolio/tree/Vineet_Resume_May2025.pdf)

## 📁 Branch Structure

- `main`: Contains this instruction file.
- `Month-Year` (e.g., `April-2025`, `May-2025`, etc.): Each branch holds the CV uploaded during that month.

Feel free to explore how my profile evolves over time.
